<strong>Year:</strong> 2020

<strong>Conference & Journal:</strong> Federated Learning(by 丛明舒)

### The problems can be solved:

- Prohibitive communication cost when using canonical Shapley Value
- Canonical Shapley Value neglects the order of data sources, yet in FL the importance of a data source
